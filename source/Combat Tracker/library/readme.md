# MapTool Combat Tracker

This add-on library contains a more (hopefully) intuitive and usable combat tracker
for MapTool. 

It is unfortunately not a complete replacement, as it is not currently possible to 
consume events for adding and remove tokens from the initiative. 

With that caveat, this library is intended to be as complete a replacement as 
possible, with only minimal usage of the functions built into MapTool.
