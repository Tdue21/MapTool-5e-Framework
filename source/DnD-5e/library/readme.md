# MapTool D&D 5e Framework
This is a D&D 5e framework for MapTool, based heavily on Rod Takehara's 
excellent Framework.

The original purpose was to convert the original framework into an add-on 
library. Primarily for the sake of easier code maintenance.

This turns out to be a huge undertaking, and it is really difficult to 
remember what has been converted and what it is still not working as intended. 

Instead I am rebuilding the original framework from Takehara from the bottom
up, so I have much more control over the process and where I am in it.

This will also allow me to rewrite code much more easily, instead of fearing
I'll break something down the road.
