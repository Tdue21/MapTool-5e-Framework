# MapTool D&D 5e Framework
This is a derivative D&D 5e framework for [MapTool][MapTool], based on Rod 
Takehara's excellent [Framework][5eFramework].

The purpose at this point, is to convert the original framework into an add-on
library. This is done primarily for the sake of easier code maintenance.

Additionally, it is the hope to eventually start improving and adding to the
framework, as Rod has not been able to do any significant work on his framework
for quite some time. 

> [!NOTE]
> It is not the intention to take over the framework, until Rod actively 
> greenlights it. Until then, this is as much a private effort and a learning
> experience as anything else. 

## Roadmap
Once I have figured out the roadmap, I will write it here ;)
